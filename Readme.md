# Moonbeam Presentations

This repository is a place where you will find all the presentations and their corresponding examples.

## Getting started

We've put each presentation in a different branch. To get started you can clone the full repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/PureStake/moonbeam-presentations
cd moonbeam-presentations
```

Then you can check all the different branches (presentations) available:

```
git branch
```

Choose the presentation you want to checkout (literally) and run:

```
git checkout PRESENTATION-NAME-HERE
```

And that is it! 

Have fun :)
